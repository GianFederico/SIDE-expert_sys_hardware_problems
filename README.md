# SIDE-expert_sys_hardware_problems
A simple implementation in Prolog of a small expert system to assist individuals in identifying hardware-related problems with their PC.
The system uses backtracking through the Prolog inference engine and prompts the user for the necessary information to explore all possible diagnoses.
Implemented also "how" and "why" questions in order to improve the level of trustworthiness and transparency of the system.

In order to use it: consult the user_interaction_module and call start\0:
