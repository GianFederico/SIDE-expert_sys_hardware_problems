# SIDE-expert_sys_hardware_problems
A simple toy example in Prolog that attempts to implement a small expert system to assist individuals in identifying hardware-related problems with their PC.
The system uses backtracking through the Prolog inference engine and prompts the user for the necessary information to explore all possible diagnoses.

In order to use it: consult the two modules and call start\0.
